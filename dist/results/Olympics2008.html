	Frazer Will of Star City, Saskatchewan took to the mats at the Olympics in Beijing, China on Friday, August 9th, 2008. He finished in seventh place in a field of 33 competitors. Here is a detailed recount of Frazer Will's Olympic competition.
	<p>
	Will was defeated in his first match against Ruben Houkes of the Netherlands. Will went the distance and after the full 5 minute match, both competitors had been penalized with 1 shido, giving them each a koka but Houkes had also scored a Yuko.
	<p>
	The Olympic draw style is repechage. Frazer Will would only be able to compete in the repechage if Houkes won his pool. If Houkes was beaten at any point in the draw, Will would not have been able to compete again.
	<p>
	In Houkes' second match, he defeated Lavrentios Alexanidis of Greece. He then won Pool A by defeating Javier Antonio Guedez Sanchez of Venezuela in his 3rd match by a Yuko. This put Frazer Will into the repechage!
	<p>
	Frazer Will faced Lavrentios Alexanidis of Greece in the first round of the repechage. Will defeated him by Ippon at 4:43.  <a href="http://www.judovision.org/?p=1754" target="blank"><font color="red"><b>VIDEO!</b></font></a>
	<p>
	Frazer Will then faced Javier Antonio Guedez Sanchez of Venezuela in the second round of the repechage. Will defeated him by Ippon at 1:54.
	<p>
	In Frazer Will's fouth match, the third round of the repechage, he was defeated by Rishod Sobirov of Uzbekistan after a full 5 minutes. Sobirov scored a yuko and koka for 15 and 10 second holds. Sobirov finished with a bronze medal. Houkes who defeated Frazer in his first match also went on to win the Olympic Bronze medal.

		BEIJING -- At five-foot-one, Frazer Will reached Olympian heights on Saturday.
		<p>
		The 26-year-old product of Star City, now living in Montreal, finished seventh in the men's 60-kilogram division in judo at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Will split his four matches during the one-day competition in his weight class.
		<p>
		"It's kind of bittersweet," said Will, who was eliminated from medal contention when he lost to Rishod Sobirov of Uzbekistan. "I'm happy to be at the Olympics and happy to have won two matches. I finished in seventh place and that was my goal to begin with, but once you've got that goal, it's the mountaintop, right? You always want to get higher -- especially in that last match."
		<p>
		Sobirov could not have gotten any higher during the early stages of the repechage final against Will. The Canadian judoka, ranked 19th in the world in his category, lifted Sobirov over his head but could not complete the throw.
		<p>
		"Judo players are very agile, so he adjusted his weight in the air," said Will, who would have advanced to the bronze-medal final if he had disposed of Sobirov.
		<p>
		"Judo players nowadays are more like gymnasts. A lot of people spin out. You see it all the time. I'm not going to dwell on it."
		<p>
		That said, Will was momentarily salivating at the thought of slamming his opponent. "I'm thinking, 'It's over, baby! It's over!' " Will said with a chuckle. "I was ready to do the victory dance, but it just wasn't meant to be."
		<p>
		Will attributed his defeat to an inability to maintain momentum throughout the match. Sobirov was declared victorious after applying holds that lasted 15 and 10 seconds.
		<p>
		"I thought I started out very well," Will said. "I had some good attacks. I felt good out there -- maybe a little too good. I ended up opening up a little bit and he got me with a few scores and I just couldn't get it back. I made a few gripping mistakes at the end.
		<p>
		"I think I could have done a few things better, but that's judo. You win and you lose. It feels a hell of a lot better to win, but that's life."
		<p>
		Life in judo has been rewarding for Will, who took up the sport when he was 14. The next 12 years were spent working toward one day -- that being Saturday.
		<p>
		Because the weight class was decided in one hectic day, Will did not have the time or inclination to savour his introduction to the Olympics.
		<p>
		"I tried to not soak it in," said Will, who was the only Canadian to compete in judo on Saturday. "I found as soon as I started thinking about the Olympics, my heartbeat rose to 180. I tried to stay as calm as possible. I didn't even watch the opening ceremonies on the TV (Friday) night. I just heard all the fireworks. I was in a good mindset. We have a good sports psychologist working with us and my coach kept me calm."
		<p>
		Will lost his opening match to Ruben Houkes of the Netherlands, but rebounded with back-to-back victories over Lavrentios Alexanidis (Greece) and Javier Antonio Guedez Sanchez (Venezuela) before opposing Sobirov.
		<p>
		"It means everything to me (to reach the Olympics)," he said. "When I was a kid, my goal wasn't necessarily to come to the Olympics, but I always loved watching it on TV. As I grew older and started loving the sport of judo more, this is the pinnacle. This is the highest you can get. Actually, the highest you can get is a gold medal at the Olympics, but making it here is very special."
		<p>
		And immensely satisfying, in light of the ribbing Will has absorbed as a result of his height.
		<p>
		"People always make fun of me, but I take it pretty kind-heartedly and just rub it off," the three-time national champion said. "It's fun. Most of the time, if someone wants to insult me, it's because they're insecure about themselves.
		<p>
		"Judo, I just started because a friend was winning medals and I saw his name in the newspaper. I asked him about it and he said, 'Just come and give it a shot,' and I did. I was kind of natural at it. I had two brothers, so I was fighting for my life already, so I thought, 'Why not throw a judogi on and make it a profession?' "
